# Group inheritance
#
# Any inherited groups prefixed with a g: are global groups
# and are inherited from the GlobalGroups.yml.
#
# Groups without the g: prefix are groups local to this world
# and are defined in the this groups.yml file.
#
# Local group inheritances define your promotion tree when using 'manpromote/mandemote'
